# qi-interpreter

## About

A fully-featured interpreter written in C++ for our custom Qi programming language. More details about the language and supported features will be posted here soon.

## Running locally

To try out Qi yourself, first clone this repo:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/malav-mehta/qi-interpreter.git
```

Next, compile the project using the Makefile:

```shell
$ cd qi-interpreter
$ make
```

### Usage

To run a program after building the project, go to the build directory:

```shell
$ cd build
```

Then, run the executable:

```shell
$ ./qi path/to/file.qi
```

The code in the file located at `path/to/file.qi` will be interpreted by the program.
