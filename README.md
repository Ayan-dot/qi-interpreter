A fully-featured interpreter written in C++ for our custom Qi programming language. For more details about the language and supported features, checkout our [documentation](./docs).

## Running locally

To try out Qi yourself, first clone this repo:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/malav-mehta/qi-interpreter.git
```

Next, compile the project using the Makefile:

```shell

$ make
```

### Usage

To run a program after building the project, go to the build directory:
