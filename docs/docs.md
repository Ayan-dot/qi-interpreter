Welcome to the documentation for Qi version 1.0! 

**Our documentation is composed of 3 major sections, as listed below:**

[Interpreter Construction]() -  Documenting the process of constructing our custom language interpreter.

[Language and Syntax Reference]() - A description of all relevant syntax and objects in the language.
